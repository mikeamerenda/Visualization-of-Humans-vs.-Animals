# Visualization-of-Humans-vs.-Animals
This visualization is to show data collected regarding what percent of humans think they can beat each animal in a fight. This data combine males and females.
When looking at this data their are a few interesting data points. The most interesting is that less than 10 percent of humans thing they can beat a goose in a fight, but more than 10 perecnt beieve they can beat much larger animals including a grizzly bear, a wolf, and a lion.
When looking at this data and graph we can see that the larger and more dangerous the animal is, the less amount of people think they can win in a fight. The only outlier we see is the goose which is a small animal that is not considered to be very danerous
